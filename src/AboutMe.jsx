      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>In January 2017, I moved to Chicago to begin my professional career after completing my Bachelor's Degree at Indiana University a few months prior. In that time, I've deeply connected with the community here and persistently strive to learn from the perspectives and experiences of others. <br/>Throughout the entirety of my professional life, I have balanced working full-time with my expansive skills and interests, especially during the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
      <p>From its outset, my goal was to keep my body and mind healthy and continuously improving. I was fortunately able to maintain full-time employment, and eventually honed my desire to grow into becoming a fullstack web developer. </p>
      <p>I first explored my curiosity by completing Google's IT Support Certification, and was exposed to the prospect of coding and navigating terminals. Despite the daunting task of then learning to code with no foundation, I eventually enrolled and successfully completed FullStack Academy's Web Developer Bootcamp.
       <br/>While certainly fast-paced and daunting to learn, web development has already become one of my most rewarding and exciting pursuits; it almost feels as if I've gained a superpower I'm thrilled to wield. </p>
      <p>During and since my completion of this course, I have worked on several projects and am thrilled to continue my work. </p>
